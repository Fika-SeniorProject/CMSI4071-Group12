Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Fika
=========================

Proposal Document [3 points]:
-----------------------------
Well done on the proposal document!  The description of what the application
will do is clear and concise and you include a couple of similar programs so
the reader can compare.  I like the idea of focusing on coffee rather than
an entire restaurant ~ there are many coffee afficionados and afficionadas
who can benefit.  I can't wait to try it out!

The justification section is good, and will make use of the skill sets of
all of you while still giving you new knowledge to integrate.  You have a
good analysis of your team skills and I have no doubt this will be a very
successful project!


Proposal Presentation [2 points]:
---------------------------------
Your presentation was very good, met all the requirements as listed, and
provided enough detail so the audience saw interested without having so
much text that they couldn't read it all before the next slide appeared.
I enjoyed the presentation and you answered questions well.  The graphics
are very nice and I like that you have some mock-up examples included.

Overall, very good!

Summary:
--------
Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.

5 out of 5 which is an A-plus on this deliverable.
