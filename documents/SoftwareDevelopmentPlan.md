## 4.1 Plan Introduction      
This Software Development Plan provides the details of the planned development for the Fika Web Application CSCI, a dedicated platform for discovering, reviewing, and logging visits to coffee shops based on specific criteria like parking, seating, and amenity availability.      

The Fika application addresses the current fragmentation of coffee shop information by condensing data from various platforms (e.g., Google Reviews, TikTok) into a single, specialized tool. Its core value lies in providing specific details relevant to coffee shop goers, such as Wi-Fi, outlets, and seating capacity, which are often absent from general restaurant review sites. The application will be developed using a Next.js frontend, a PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase, and integrated with OpenStreetMaps for geographical data visualization. Development activities include architectural design, implementation of the frontend (Discover, Cafe, and User Logging pages) and backend APIs, integration of third-party services (Firebase for authentication, Vega for visualization), and continuous testing.      

The project's major milestones are scheduled as follows:    
* Requirements Specification Finalization: Week 05    
* Software Development Plan (SDP) Completion: Week 07     
* Architectural Design Completion (SDD Part 1): Week 10    
* Detailed Design & Test Plan Finalization (SDD Part 2): Week 12    
* Alpha/Beta Demonstration & Critical Design Review: Weeks 13-14    
* Final Project Demonstration: Week 15    
* Final Product Delivery & Code Freeze: Week 16

## 4.2 Project Resources   
Resources are critical elements that must be managed to ensure project completion. This section details the hardware and software assets required for the development and deployment of Fika.      

### 4.2.1 Hardware Resources     
Following are the hardware requirements for development of fika:  

| Category          | Requirement                              |  
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|  
| Processor         | Intel i5 (8th Gen) or Apple M1 or higher |  
| Hard Drive Space  | 20 GB free space                         |  
| RAM               | 8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended          |  
| Display           | 1280x800 resolution or higher            |  
| Network           | Broadband internet connection required   |  

### 4.2.2 Software Resources            
Following are the software requirements for development of fika:  

| Category          | Requirement                                   |
