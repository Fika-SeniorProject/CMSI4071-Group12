Software Development Plan
CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
=======================================

INTRODUCTION/DELIVERABLES SECTION:
----------------------------------
Strengths
   Clear project scope: The introduction effectively defines the purpose
      of the Fika app, its target users, and the problem it solves
      (fragmented coffee shop data).
   Technology stack identified: Specifies the use of Next.js, Supabase,
      OpenStreetMaps, Firebase, and Vega.
   Development activities outlined: Includes architectural design,
      frontend/backend implementation, third-party integration, and
      testing.
   Milestones listed: Key dates for requirements, design, testing, and
      delivery are clearly stated.
Suggestions
   Clarify methodology: While the plan follows a waterfall-like
      structure, explicitly stating that the project uses the waterfall
      model would improve alignment with the assignment.
   Include a brief summary of each phase: A short paragraph explaining
      how the team will transition from one phase to the next
      (e.g., from design to implementation) would reinforce the waterfall
      structure.


PROJECT RESOURCES SECTION:
----------------------------------
4.2.1 Hardware Resources
   Strengths
      Realistic and sufficient: Lists minimum and recommended specs for
         processor, RAM, storage, and display.
      Network requirement included: Notes the need for broadband internet,
         which is essential for a web app.
   Suggestions
      Clarify testing hardware: Mention if mobile or tablet testing will
         be conducted, especially since the app is web-based and may be
         accessed on various devices.
4.2.2 Software Resources
   Strengths
      Detailed and relevant: Lists all necessary tools, frameworks,
         and APIs.
      Justifications included: Explains why certain tools (e.g., Supabase,
         PostgreSQL 15+) were chosen.
      Covers full stack: Includes frontend, backend, hosting,
         authentication, visualization, and development tools.
   Suggestions
      Add version numbers consistently: While some tools (e.g.,
         PostgreSQL 15+, Node.js 18+) are versioned, others like Supabase
         and Vega could benefit from version specification.
      Mention licensing or cost: Even if tools are free, noting this shows
         awareness of project constraints.


PROJECT ORGANIZATION SECTION:
----------------------------------
Strengths
   Clear task assignments: Each team member is assigned specific components
      (e.g., Cafe Page, Map, Logging, Filtering).
   Shared responsibilities: Common tasks like testing, data entry, and API
      research are assigned to all members.
   Balanced workload: Tasks are distributed across frontend, backend, and
      data responsibilities.
Suggestions
   Include role titles: Assigning roles like "Frontend Lead" or "Data
      Integration Specialist" would clarify leadership and accountability.
   Add communication plan: Briefly describe how the team will coordinate
      (e.g., weekly meetings, GitHub issues, Slack).


PROJECT SCHEDULE SECTION:
----------------------------------
Strengths
   Chart included: A Gantt chart is referenced and visually embedded.
   Milestones align with deliverables: The timeline supports the waterfall
      model with sequential phases.
Suggestions
   Ensure chart readability: The image path suggests the chart is external.
      Ensure it is included in the final submission and is legible.
   Highlight dependencies: Indicate which tasks rely on others to better
      reflect waterfall sequencing.
